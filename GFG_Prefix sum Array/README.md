Given an array arr[], the goal is to compute its prefix sum array. The prefix sum array, prefixSum[], should be of the same length as arr[], where each element prefixSum[i] represents the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index i, i.e., prefixSum[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + .... + arr[i].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 10, 5, 15]
Output: [10, 30, 40, 45, 60]
Explanation: For each index i, add all the elements from 0 to i:
prefixSum[0] = 10, 
prefixSum[1] = 10 + 20 = 30, 
prefixSum[2] = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 and so on.
Input: arr[] = [30, 10, 10, 5, 50]
Output: [30, 40, 50, 55, 105]
Explanation: For each index i, add all the elements from 0 to i:
prefixSum[0] = 30, 
prefixSum[1] = 30 + 10 = 40, 
prefixSum[2] = 30 + 10 + 10 = 50 and so on.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
